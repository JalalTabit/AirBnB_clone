# Welcome to Airbnb Clone Project

This project is an Airbnb clone designed from scratch to facilitate a comprehensive learning experience. It covers every aspect of constructing a complete Airbnb-like platform, encompassing the command interpreter, server-side and client-side components, storage engines, and the integration of essential frameworks and APIs.

## Command Interpreter

The Command Interpreter (CI) acts as the central hub for administrative tasks and modifications. It houses a set of robust commands that empower users to effectively manage our Airbnb-inspired website. Whether it involves overseeing property listings, managing user interactions, or configuring various platform elements, our command interpreter provides comprehensive control and functionality.
